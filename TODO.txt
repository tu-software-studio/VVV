As of 7-7-15:
 - MailChimp
    - Ensure users are only added to list if account status is 'active' (i.e.
      not 'pending'
    - Ensure formerly 'pending' users are added to the MailChimp list when their
      status is changed to 'active'.
    - Ensure users are removed from MailChimp list if account status changes
      from 'active' to 'pending'
 - Regarding the question of how to have users register to become a Friend of
    Interserve, it seems best to have only one form on the front end. They're
    emphasizing simplicity for users, so we should give it to them. Any time a
    "Support Us" form is filled out, ISV India will look through it and take any
    appropriate actions, including contacting the supporter about becoming a
    Friend if they indicated their desire to do so.
 - Plugins
    - I expect that if plugins are ever updated on the front end, it will
      remove all customizations, requiring cherry-picks and merges (meaning a
      programmer). This is pretty dangerous, but I'm not sure how to identify
 - Random
    - Add Google map to "Contact Us" form (currently it says there's supposed to
      be one, but there isn't.)
    - All pages were pretty haphazardly copied over from isvindia.com. These
      should be updated (by ISV India, so they know how all the things work).
